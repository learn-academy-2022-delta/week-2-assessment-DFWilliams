# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is used as a place holder for variables when they are called within functions. Arguments the act upon the return of a function. For example, when using the the .split() method with the argument of "" it wraps every character in the string it is converting in quotation marks. 

    console.log("Deanna".split()) // output: ['Deanna']
    console.log("Deanna".split("")) // output: ['D', 'e', 'a', 'n', 'n', 'a']
   

  Researched answer: A parameter is varialble that is a part of a function where as an argument is the actual value that is passed through the function. Also, parameters must always have a argument that goes with it. This is not the case, however, for arguments. The can be and excess of arguments and they do not need a corresponding parameter. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The parameters that .map() takes is an anonymous function and values such as value, index, and array. Value is required but index and array are optional

  Researched answer: The .map bulit-in method takes of 3 arguments value, index and array. Value is required as it is the only parameter needed when simplifying the syntax. Index, and array are not required and are used more so for additional information. 



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map is a higher order function that returns a new array that is the same length as the original, were as .filter is a higher order function that returns an array that has filtered out information we do not want and give only the information we asked for. For example, .map would be used to create a function that was take an array of numbers and return a new array with every number multiplied by 3. We would use .filter if we needed to create a function that would take an array of numbers and return an array with only the even numbers from the original array. 

  Researched answer: .map and .filter are both methods that create new arrays, however, .map acts on every element within the array and returns an array with these elements being changed in someway. .filter creates a new array by removing unwanted elements or elements that do not belong. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is an action that can be called upon, given an input and return an output. Methods are actions that are called within a function and act on the arguments within the function. 

  Researched answer: A function is code that can be reused and called whenever needed. This is helpful as it does not required you to rewrite the same code over and over. Functions and Methods similar in that they perform tasks but methods differ in that they are associated with objects. 



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructing is when you declare a variable and assign it the pathway to reach a specific key of a value within an object

  Researched answer: Object destructing is a way to assign properties/keyes of an object to a variable. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: hoisting in Javascript is to pull or move information in your code. 

  Researched answer: Hoisting in JavaScript is the act of moving declaration to the top of the current function. It allows for variables to be used before they are declared.
